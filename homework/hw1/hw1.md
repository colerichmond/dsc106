#### Analysis:

Of the five tools used in this assignment, I consider myself to be most familiar with the Google Suite family. However, making charts with Google Sheets is something I do not have much experience with. This tool did a great job putting together an initial visualization once the data was selected. Chart and axis title were something that needed to be altered upon the construction of each new chart, and the preset color schemes were certainly not welcoming to the user. The ability to alter the dataset easily was one of the features that stood out in this tool above all others. Whether that meant reversing the order of the timestamps or stripping numberical values of certain punctuation, Google Sheets made this process easy.

# Infogram

#### Pie Chart:

#### Analysis:

From a user experience standpoint, I thought Infogram had the most straightforward, easy-to-use interface for the average person looking to complete a visualization project. The ability to see the data present side-by-side with the visualization was something that I enjoyed about this tool. However, I felt as though I was limited in how far I could go with my visualization. I was unable to perform any expressions nor was I able to combine any of the columns in a meaningful way without outside sources. Furthermore, previews took a while to refresh at times. For the novice user, this tool exceeded my expectations.

# Tableau Desktop

#### Line Chart:

#### Pie Chart:

#### Analysis:

I have had some experience with Tableau, but have never had the chance to take a deep dive into what this tool has to offer. One thing that I dislike about this tool is that it's not immediately obvious what needs to go where in order to make a bar, line, or pie chart. You have several columns and dimensions at your disposal and it's unclear where they are supposed to go and what will happen when you move them around. I felt as though I was playing one big game of whack-a-mole. As soon as I would add/subtract a measure, the visualization would change and I would return to square one, unsure of how I wanted to move forward. For the experienced user, Tableau's potential seems immense but the learning curve is definitely steep.

# D3

#### Pie Chart:

#### Analysis:

I wish I had more time to spend working with D3 on this assignment. The amount of variety and the interactive nature of some of the visualizations you can construct is incredible. Similar to Tableau, the learning curve is quite steep considering a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is fairly important if you want these tools to work in your favor. What I came up with is quite basic in the grand scheme of things, but the ability to see your changes reflected instantaneously on a local host is a godsend when working with D3. One of the hard things with D3 is that if many changes are made at once, and your visualization flares up, you'll have a hard time retracing your steps in order to find out what went wrong. 

# Highcharts

#### Pie Chart:

#### Analysis:

For simple visualizations a simpler product would suffice. Highcharts is excellent when
you want to create clean, straight to the point, data visualizations. Line graphs, pie
charts, bar graphs, and the appropriate drill-downs are easy to develop and deploy. This
helps a lot when needing to develop a data visualization solution for non-technical
people. However, the lack of customizability makes it difficult to create specialized
visualizations in a pinch.
